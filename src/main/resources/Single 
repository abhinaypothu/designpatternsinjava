Single Responsibility principle
any class component or function should exactly do one thing


SRP encourage us to divide our code from monolithic files to number of files ensure lines of code should be between 50 to 100

more maintainable ,easy to read and understand

if lines of code above 150 then recomended to fragmant the code
